### Spam Message Detection
This project implements a spam message classifier using Naive Bayes algorithm. The classifier analyzes email subjects to differentiate between spam and ham(non-spam) message.<br/>
In this project I have used 2 types of Naive Bayes algorithm which are Multinomial Naive Bayes and Bernoulli Naive Bayes.<br/>
Using BOW and TFIDF vectorizer on this two algorithms, this project offers an efficient solution for message filtering.
